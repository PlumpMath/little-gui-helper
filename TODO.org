   Translate keywords from :camel-case-property -> .setCamelCaseProperty
   (any Named object is treated that way)

** TODO doprops: consider separating events and properties
   there have to be a possibility to add more than one listener, for example1:
   :+mouse.mouseUp body1
   :+mouse.mouseUp body2
   should add two listeners.

   Possible solutions:
   1. Dump the map idea (properties always as lists)
   2. separate events from properties (properties in a map, events in list)
   3. separate events from properties only when merging styles (in styles.clj)
      (bad idea probably).

* little-gui-helper/styles.clj
** TODO add more documentation to flat-styles and pair&correct-css
